          <td colspan=3> The first way we can minimize the impact of computer devices is to recycle old computer parts. When computers are no longer needed, instead of just simply discarding them, we can utilize a few of the old components to diminish the production of new ones. There are actually recycling programs in Canada that offer to recycle electronics. Such programs collect the reusable components of computers and remove precious metals with specializied extraction tools so that these minerals can be repurposed and humans are limited to the exposure of toxins.
