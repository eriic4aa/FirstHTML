          <td colspan=3> The first way we can minimize the impact of computer devices is to recycle old computer parts. When computers are no longer needed, instead of just simply discarding them, we can utilize a few of the old components to diminish the production of new ones. There are actually recycling programs in Canada that offer to recycle electronics. Such programs collect the reusable components of computers and remove precious metals with specializied extraction tools so that these minerals can be repurposed and humans are limited to the exposure of toxins.

          <tr>
          <td colspan=3>Another way we can limit the impact of computers is to repurpose our old devices. This means that when we no longer need them, we can consider handing them down to a family member, a friend, or even donating it to a good cause. This prevents waste of reusable materials and stops over crowding of landfills. There are programs that are willing to take in old devices and have them be distributed to schools all over Canada. One program in Ontario called the Renewed Computer Technology (RTC) is a non-profit organization that delivers refurbished computers to schools, First Nation bands, Indigenous communities, charities, and even families with low income. Through the Computers for Schools program, RTC, there have been at least 505,000 computer devices distributed across Ontario along with youth and business environment intern programs.
