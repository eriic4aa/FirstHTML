        <td colspan=3>One of the largest impacts that computers have on our planet is that it limits the amount of nonrenewable resources. One reason for this is the production of computers. Computers generally use many minerals found within the earth. These common minerals are silica, iron, aluminium, copper, lead, and more. All these materials used to produce computers are nonrenewable sources, meaning that they are created by a natural process. With computers being used around the world, these nonrenewable sources are starting to deplete. These materials are also unable to be replenished again which becomes a problem for us since we need many of these minerals for the production of other items.

        <td colspan=3>How these minerals become included in the creation of computers is they are minned from the Earth. Mining is known to cause serious damage to the environment as well as it can alter land formation.

        <td>Another effect that computers have on our environment is it consumes numerous amounts of energy and causes global warming. Manufacturing computers also leads to greenhouse gas emissions. The factories and machines that create these devices are emitting huge amounts of fossil fuels. And excess amounts of carbon dioxide are being released from the machines running to produce these devices. The build up of fossil fuels is the main reason for releasing greenhouse gases and is the number one cause of global warming. Greenhouse gasses are known to impact the environment by forming a layer around the Earth to trap the heat from the sun, then warm the climate.

        <td> The most major impact that computers have on our environment is the production of E-waste. E-waste is the discarding and disposal of electronic/electrical devices. Some frequently disposed e-waste items include computers, cell phones, medical equipment, household appliances, etc. Many e-waste products are being stored in buildings(homes, warehouses), dumped, illegally exported and even being recycled unsound activity. When it is recycled this way, it has the possibility to release 1000 various chemicals into the environment, along with identified neurotoxicants like lead.
