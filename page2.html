        <td colspan=3>One of the largest impacts that computers have on our planet is that it limits the amount of nonrenewable resources. One reason for this is the production of computers. Computers generally use many minerals found within the earth. These common minerals are silica, iron, aluminium, copper, lead, and more. All these materials used to produce computers are nonrenewable sources, meaning that they are created by a natural process. With computers being used around the world, these nonrenewable sources are starting to deplete. These materials are also unable to be replenished again which becomes a problem for us since we need many of these minerals for the production of other items.

        <td colspan=3>How these minerals become included in the creation of computers is they are minned from the Earth. Mining is known to cause serious damage to the environment as well as it can alter land formation.
